<p class="left-text">Summary:<br>She was a mother who was a ghoul in a society that hates ghouls. She tried to be the best mother she could raising her child, safe from danger and teaching her to be a good person. Her husband died and she was left alone with her child. It was so sad because it was a mother doing everything she can from the ghoul hating humans and we saw how good of a mother she was. She fought and fended off as much as she could and she ended up dying for her daughter to escape. Her daughter ends up encountering her mothers' killer. The killer used her own mother's Kagune to try and kill her and to see that confrontation of the daughter having to fight against a part of their own mother was just heart-wrenching.
