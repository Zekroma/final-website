<p class="right-text">Summary:<br>Marco Bodt was a normal solider and was a nice but nervous person. When we first find out he died it was sad but not too unexpected because of how many people die on average. When we find out how he died is when feels start hitting. It cuts back to seeing him alive and seeing something he shouldn't have. People he saw as friends were up to something that he wasn't supposed to find out. They have to get rid of him they think so they end up taking off his ODM gear while he pleads for his life. They end up pushing him off a building to a titan and watch him get eaten.</p>
