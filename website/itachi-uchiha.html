<p class="centered-text">Summary:<br>Itachi Uchiha was first known as part of this shady group and Sasuke’s older brother. He killed his whole village, left his brother alive, and joined the Atatsuki. We go through the story thinking why he would do all this an then we finally find out. It’s because he had too. We find out that he’s probably one of the nicest and strongest ninjas out there and that with everything he has done he had to do it. He was dying of a disease and prolonged his life to help his brother become stronger and how to use his power. Learning all of this and everything he has done and why and the two brothers confrontation with each other with each other and the let out of emotions is so sad to watch.
