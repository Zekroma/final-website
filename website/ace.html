<p class="centered-text">Summary:<br>Ace throughout the series was made to look like this stronger older brother. He was known as a great pirate, brother, and general person. People loved him, crew  members respected him, and the navy feared him with his flaming heart. He went off on a mission to capture a crew mate who committed a terrible crime: killing another crew mate. We see the fierce fight and learn later that he was captured. Lift goes to save him from jail but barely misses him. Ace is now on the execution stand. His Captain, Whitebeard, wages a war on the navy base that is doing it and kiddy joins in too to save his brother. After the intense battle he ends up saving ace but after Liffey is targeted and almost gets hit with something that would’ve killed him Ace jumps in between and gets punched through the chest. Ace dies and Luffy can’t handle it. We see his breakdown and just tears start flooding.
