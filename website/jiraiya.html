<p class="left-text">Summary:<br>Jiraiya was first introduced as this pervy old man but then we discover that he's actually pretty powerful and wise. The MC now becomes a student under him and that starts a whole new bonding between these two. Jiraiya starts taking care of him, helps him get stronger, and they help each other perfect a technique. He ends up being around for almost half of Naruto's life and becomes a huge figure for him. When Naruto goes away for a bit he comes back to find out that Jiraiya took a dangerous mission and died. We later find out that it was by one of his own students too. To see the reaction of Naruto and just the sheer devastation was so sad to watch and experience.
