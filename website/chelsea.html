<p class="left-text">Summary:<br>Chelsea was a new recruit to the team and was taken as blunt but caring, kind, and mischievous. She was good at what she does and we came to know what happened in the past. Her old team was slaughtered and with her new team, she didn't want that to happen again so she was blunt but accurate with her new team. She wanted her team to like her even if it didn't come off like that and she deeply cared for them. Her death was brutal to the point where just her head was presented to show that she died and to lower the morale of the team. This was made even worse when she died and what she was thinking. "How happy her team was gonna be with her job well done and her return"
