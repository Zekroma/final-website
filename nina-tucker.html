<p class="centered-text">Summary:<br>Koro Sensei was an alien from space that could destroy the world but what ends up happening is that he gets a job as a teacher with students getting trained to kill him. He ends up teaching them a lot and he and his students become quite close. Even the other adults bonded with him. Over the course of him teaching them they end up learning a lot and about themselves too. In the end, they do manage to kill him but the final moment is him saying that he was happy and that they should do it. When he is dead everyone starts to cry and I mean everyone starts crying. Even the people you wouldn't have guessed.
